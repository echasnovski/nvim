# Snippet collection

This is a collection of VSCode-like snippets for my most commonly used languages.
Placed in 'after/snippets' to have them override snippets from 'rafamadriz/friendly-snippets' if loaded, as this is how 'mini.snippets' loading should work.

This was manually crafted thanks to the following sources and instruments:

- [friendly-snippets](https://github.com/rafamadriz/friendly-snippets)
- [vim-snippets](https://github.com/honza/vim-snippets)
- [convert-snippets](https://github.com/VincentCordobes/convert-snippets)

## Add new collection

Steps to create new collection:

- Create and edit file using already present ones for reference.
