--- *mini.input* Get user input
---
--- MIT License Copyright (c) 2026 Evgeni Chasnovski

--- Features:
---
--- - Get user input with full customizability of how to handle key presses and
---   how to show the current state.
---
--- - Built-in configurable views as floating window, statusline/tabline/winbar,
---   virtual line/text.
---
--- - Implementation is non-blocking but waits to return the input. It also works
---   in any mode without requiring mode change. See |MiniInput-lifecycle|.
---
--- - |vim.ui.input()| implementation. To adjust, use |MiniInput.ui_input()| or
---   save-restore `vim.ui.input` manually after calling |MiniInput.setup()|.

---
--- # Setup ~
---
--- This module needs a setup with `require('mini.input').setup({})` (replace `{}`
--- with your `config` table). It will create global Lua table `MiniInput` which
--- you can use for scripting or manually (with `:lua MiniInput.*`).
---
--- See |MiniInput.config| for `config` structure and default values.
---
--- You can override runtime config settings locally to buffer inside
--- `vim.b.miniinput_config` which should have same structure as
--- `MiniInput.config`. See |mini.nvim-buffer-local-config| for more details.
---
--- # Comparisons ~
---
--- - [folke/snacks.nvim#input](https://github.com/folke/snacks.nvim):
---     - Both provide |vim.ui.input()| implementation.
---     - Has asynchronous implementation (i.e. does not wait for user to finish
---       input), while this module has synchronous non-blocking implementation.
---     - Uses floating window and forced Insert mode. This module allows more
---       view customizations and can be used in any mode without interruptions.
---
--- - |input()|:
---     - Both are synchronous.
---     - Both allow custom highlight and completion.
---     - This module also allows supplying input scope and visibility,
---       customizing keys and view.
---
--- # Highlight groups ~
--- *MiniInput-hl-groups*
---
--- - `MiniInputAdded`   - added text during completion navigation.
--- - `MiniInputBorder`  - border of a |MiniInput.gen_view.floatwin()| handler.
--- - `MiniInputCaret`   - caret symbol shown in a prompt area.
--- - `MiniInputHide`    - input is hidden, usually used instead of `MiniInputPrompt`.
--- - `MiniInputHint`    - hints shown during completion navigation.
--- - `MiniInputNormal`  - basic foreground/background.
--- - `MiniInputPrompt`  - input prompt (intention of the input).
--- - `MiniInputSpecial` - special keys (like literal `\t`, `\n`, etc.) in input.

--- Information about the state of the input. It is used as a handler argument and
--- can be get via |MiniInput.get_state()|. A table with the following fields:
---
--- - <caret> `(number)` - character (not byte) index at which to modify input.
---   Should be from 1 (prepend input) to "input width plus 1" (append input).
---
--- - <complete> `(table|nil)` - information about active completion navigation.
---   If present, it means that completion navigation is in action.
---   Its fields describe the state of navigation:
---     - <base> `(string)` - reference text to the left of caret at the start
---       of completion. Used to compute candidates. Can be empty string.
---     - <id> `(number)` - identifier of current completion item. Can be zero to
---       mean that the base is shown. If not zero, must mean that a `items[id]`
---       candidate is now shown to the left of caret as the part of the input.
---     - <items> `(table)` - string array of completion candidates. May be empty.
---       Are intended to fully replace <base>, so should contain it in any sense.
---     - <method> `(string)` - completion method. Like `"default"`, `"history"`, etc.
---       Can be `""` (empty string) to mean "default method of complete handler".
---
--- - <data> `(table)` - any information to be reused within the same input session.
---   Note: handlers should not change fields that they don't "own".
---
--- - <errmsg> `(errmsg)` - first error message caught during input process.
---
--- - <highlight> `(table|nil)` - information about current input highlighting.
---   If absent, the whole input is highlighted using `MiniInputNormal` group.
---   Should be an array of highlight ranges. They might be not ordered, overlap,
---   go outside of input width. It is up to the view handler to decide how to
---   interpret them. See |MiniInput.state_to_chunks()| for a helper.
---   Fields of a single highlight range:
---     - <from> `(number)` - character index (one-indexed) of range start.
---     - <to> `(number)` - character index (one-indexed) of range end (inclusive).
---       Should not be smaller than <from>. Can be |math.huge|.
---     - <hl> `(string)` - highlight group to use for highlighting.
---
--- - <input> `(string)` - current user input. Returned by |MiniInput.get()|.
---
--- - <opts> `(table)` - input options, same as in |MiniInput.get()|.
---
--- - <prompt> `(string)` - intention of the input. May be empty.
---
--- - <status> `(string)` - one of `"start"`, `"progress"`, `"accept"`, `"cancel"`.

--- Defaults ~
---@eval return MiniDoc.afterlines_to_code(MiniDoc.current.eval_section)
---@text # Handlers ~
--- *MiniInput.config.handlers*
---
--- `config.handlers` defines functions that are applied during |MiniInput-lifecycle|.
--- Every handler takes |MiniInput-state| as the first argument and is expected to
--- either modify it in place or return a new state table.
---
--- Use |MiniInput.apply_handler()| to apply a handler for a given |MiniInput-state|.
--- They can be set up as part of the config (will be used as default) or passed
--- directly as a part of |MiniInput.get()| call.
---
--- ## Complete ~
---
--- `handlers.complete` is a handler intended to compute completion suggestions.
--- Takes |MiniInput-state| and `method` as arguments and is expected to modify
--- <complete> field. Default: |MiniInput.default_complete()|.
---
--- Only `complete.base` and `complete.items` are expected to be set by a complete
--- handler. Setting and modifying other fields (`complete.id` and `complete.method`)
--- is done in other handlers and as part of |MiniInput.apply_handler()|. Actually
--- showing completion information is up to the view handler.
---
--- This handler is usually applied manually as a part of the key handler via
--- using |MiniInput.apply_handler(state, 'complete',method)|. Like, for example,
--- in |MiniInput.default_key()| after <Tab> or <Up>.
---
--- Here is an example of a simple demo complete handler: >lua
---
---   local complete_handler = function(state, method)
---     if method == '' or method == 'xy' then
---       local text = vim.fn.strcharpart(state.input, 0, state.caret - 1)
---       local base = text:match('%S*$')
---       state.complete = { base = base, items = { base .. 'x', base .. 'y' } }
---       return
---     end
---     return MiniInput.default_complete(state, method)
---   end
---
---   require('mini.input').setup({ handlers = { complete = complete_handler } })
---<
--- ## Key ~
---
--- `handlers.key` is a handler intended to process every user key press.
--- Takes |MiniInput-state| and `key` as arguments. Argument `key` represents a key
--- that needs to be processed: a string if from the user input or `nil` if input
--- needs to be set up, refreshed, or torn down. Default: |MiniInput.default_key()|.
---
--- A string `key` can be two kinds:
--- - Forwarded from |getcharstr()| verbatim as a result of interactive key press.
---   Meaning it will be in escaped form and not as a |key-notation|: i.e. `"\r"`
---   and not `"<CR>"`. It also means that all kinds of combos (`<M-...>`, `<C-S-...>`),
---   mouse clicks, and wheel scrolls are also forwarded to key handler.
--- - Any string as part of `opts.init_keys` in |MiniInput.get()|. If a string
---   doesn't look like it came from |getcharstr()|, it is usually a good idea
---   to insert this string at caret as is.
---
--- The suggested overall approach for custom key handler is "if `key` is special -
--- act on it, if can be used in the input - insert at caret, ignore otherwise".
--- It is also important to never change the current Neovim mode to
--- keep |MiniInput.get()| working as expected.
---
--- Here is an example of a basic custom key handler: >lua
---
---   local custom_actions = {
---     [vim.keycode('<Left>')] = function(state)
---       state.caret = math.max(state.caret - 1, 1)
---     end,
---     [vim.keycode('<Right>')] = function(state)
---       local input_width = vim.fn.strchars(state.input)
---       state.caret = math.min(state.caret + 1, input_width + 1)
---     end,
---     [vim.keycode('<CR>')] = function(state) state.status = 'accept' end,
---     [vim.keycode('<Esc>')] = function(state) state.status = 'cancel' end,
---   }
---
---   local key_handler = function(state, key)
---     -- No need for special setup or teardown
---     if key == nil then return end
---
---     -- If key is special - act on it
---     if custom_actions[key] then return custom_actions[key](state) end
---
---     -- If key is not printable - do nothing
---     if vim.fn.match(key, '^[[:print:]]\\+$') < 0 then return end
---
---     -- Insert at caret
---     local caret, input = state.caret, state.input
---     local before_caret = vim.fn.strcharpart(input, 0, caret - 1)
---     local after_caret = vim.fn.strcharpart(input, caret - 1)
---     state.input = before_caret .. key .. after_caret
---     state.caret = caret + vim.fn.strchars(key)
---
---     -- No need to return anything as `state` is modified in place
---   end
---
---   require('mini.input').setup({ handlers = { key = key_handler } })
--- <
--- ## Highlight ~
---
--- `handlers.highlight` is a handler intended to compute and set highlight info
--- about the current input. Takes |MiniInput-state| as the only argument and is
--- expected to modify <highlight> field. Default: |MiniInput.default_highlight()|.
---
--- See |MiniInput.gen_highlight| for built-in highlight handler generators.
---
--- It is usually a good idea to append to a <highlight> if it already exists.
--- This makes it work more robustly when combining highlights.
---
--- Here is a basic example that highlights all letters `a`: >lua
---
---   local hl_handler = function(state)
---     local highlight = {}
---     for col in string.gmatch(state.input, '()a') do
---       -- NOTE: range should use character (not byte) indexes
---       local char_col = vim.fn.charidx(state.input, col)
---       local range = { from = char_col, to = char_col, hl = 'Special' }
---       table.insert(highlight, range)
---     end
---
---     state.highlight = vim.list_extend(state.highlight or {}, highlight)
---
---     -- Possibly also apply default handler afterwards
---     return MiniInput.default_highlight(state)
---   end
---
---   require('mini.input').setup({ handlers = { highlight = hl_handler } })
--- <
--- ## View ~
---
--- `handlers.view` is a handler intended to show the input state on screen.
--- Takes |MiniInput-state| as the only argument. Default: |MiniInput.default_view()|.
---
--- See |MiniInput.gen_view| for built-in view handler generators.
---
--- Example of view that uses |nvim_echo()| to show the input: >lua
---
---   local view_handler = function(state)
---     -- Process start and end of the input lifecycle
---     local is_start = state.status == 'start'
---     local is_end = state.status == 'accept' or state.status == 'cancel'
---     if is_start or is_end then vim.cmd('mode') end
---     if is_end then return end
---
---     -- Compute text-hl chunks that fit and show them
---     local chunks = MiniInput.state_to_chunks(state, vim.v.echospace)
---     vim.api.nvim_echo(chunks, false, {})
---   end
---
---   require('mini.input').setup({ handlers = { view = view_handler } })
--- <
--- # Scope ~
---
--- `config.scope` is a string that defines an input scope. It is meant as an extra
--- information for handlers to tweak their behavior (`view` style, etc.). Possible
--- values: `"cursor"`, `"line"`, `"buffer"`, `"window"`, `"tabpage"`, `"editor"`, `"project"`.
MiniInput.config = {
  -- Functions that control input lifecycle
  handlers = {
    -- Compute completion candidates
    complete = nil,

    -- Compute highlighting of current input
    highlight = nil,

    -- Handle input start, every key press, and input end

--- Get input from the user
---
--- # Lifecycle ~
--- *MiniInput-lifecycle*
---
--- This module implements custom lifecycle to interact with the user. It starts
--- when calling |MiniInput.get()| and ends with it returning a value.
--- Only one active input is allowed simultaneously.
---
--- The basic cycle unit is a step that processes a `key` (string or `nil`). It is
--- done by calling relevant handlers in order: key handler with `key` as a second
--- argument, highlight handler, view handler. |MiniInput.apply_handler()| is used
--- to apply each handler and the output of one is used as the input for the next.
---
--- During step some state fields are automatically removed:
--- - <highlight> is removed before applying a key handler to always have the most
---   up to date highlighting.
--- - <complete> is removed after applying a key handler if it was not changed but
---   something else in the state did change. This is meant as an automatic stop
---   of completion when it is not advancing.
---
--- If step sets an ending state <status> (i.e. `"accept"` or `"cancel"`), the input
--- is finished by extra finishing step (see below).
---
--- The order of operations is as follows:
--- - Create initial |MiniInput-state| based on the input `opts`, with defaults
---   inferred from |MiniInput.config|, and `vim.b.miniinput_config`.
--- - Set <status> to `"start"`.
--- - Advance one step with `key=nil`. This is meant as a "setup" step for handlers.
--- - Set <status> to `"progress"`.
--- - Process `opts.init_keys` one item per step with `key` set to the string item.
--- - Wait for user to press a key (via |getcharstr()|). The key string (in escaped
---   form and not as a |key-notation|; i.e. `"\r"` and not `"<CR>"`) is then used
---   to advance a step. Note: <C-c> is hard coded to cancel the input.
--- - Repeat previous step until the ending <status> (`"accept"` or `"cancel"`).
--- - Finish the input:
---     - Perform a "teardown"' step with `key=nil`.
---     - If <errmsg> is set, throw an |error()|.
---     - If input is accepted (even if empty) and not hidden, add to <input> to
---       the history. Get the whole history with |MiniInput.get_history()|.
---     - Return <input> if <status> is `"accept"`, `nil` otherwise.
---
---@param opts table|nil Options. Possible fields:
---   - <completion> `(string)` - completion method. Default: `''` to use default
---     completion method of the `complete` handler.
---   - <handlers> `(table)` - same as in |MiniInput.config.handlers|, used only for
---     the duration of the current input.
---   - <hide> `(boolean)` - whether input should be hidden. Default: `false`.
---     Note: this does not guarantee a total security of the input, only that
---     the typed characters are expected to not be shown on screen and not added
---     to the history. If set:
---       - The `view` handler is expected to not directly show current input.
---         Like replace characters with pre-defined string or fully not show.
---       - The `complete` and `highlight` handlers are not called.
---       - Accepted input will not be added to the history.
---   - <init_keys> `(table)` - array of string keys that are emulated before asking
---     for the user input. Using values that can be an output of |getcharstr()|
---     should be preferred, but a key handler should work with any string.
---     Default: `{}`.
---   - <prompt> `(string)` - intention of the input, same as in |input()|.
---     Default: `"Input"`.
---   - <scope> `(string)` - same as in |MiniInput.config|. Default: the value from
---     `MiniInput.config` with some hard coded exceptions (on Neovim<0.12.3):
---       - |vim.lsp.buf.rename()| will use `"cursor"` if no `new_name` is supplied.
---
---@return string|nil User input (from the <input> state field) if accepted, even if
---   empty. `nil` if canceled or there was an active input.

--- View generators
---
--- This is a table with function elements. Call to actually get a view function.
---
--- Each element accepts <to_chunks> option. It is a function that takes
--- a |MiniInput-state| and `max_width` arguments and returns an array of `{ text, hl }`
--- chunks that fit into `max_width` display width (as in |strdisplaywidth()|).
---
--- This is a way to adjust how input is shown. Like caret/hide symbols, etc.
--- By default uses |MiniInput.state_to_chunks()|, which also means:
--- - All special characters (like literal `\t`, `\n`, etc.) will be translated
---   via |keytrans()|.
---
--- Example: >lua
---
---   local input = require('mini.input')
---
---   -- Adjust how state is converted to text-hl chunks
---   local to_chunks_opts = {
---     symbol_caret = '_',
---     symbol_hide = '*',
---     -- Do not include prompt and hint in `floatwin` handler
---     include_prompt = false,
---     include_hint = false,
---   }
---   local to_chunks = function(state, max_width)
---     return MiniInput.state_to_chunks(state, max_width, to_chunks_opts)

---   -- Supply custom `to_chunks` as an option
---   local view_opts = { to_chunks = to_chunks }
---   input.setup({ handlers = { view = input.gen_view.floatwin(view_opts) } })

--- Each element also accepts <style> option which fine tunes the input view.
--- With default key handler (|MiniInput.default_key()|) it can be adjusted
--- interactively by pressing <C-s>.
MiniInput.gen_view = {}

--- Floating window view
---
--- Show input inside a floating window. Prompt and completion hints are shown
--- as title and footer.
---
--- Window position and dimensions are computed based on state's <scope> and
--- `opts.style`:
--- - `scope="cursor"` is shown near the cursor. For example, `style="BL"` will
---   have bottom left corner at nearest top right cell relative to the cursor.
--- - `scope="line"` is shown near the current line. For example, `style="BL"` will
---   have bottom left corner at left side above the line.
--- - `scope="buffer"` and `scope="window"` will be shown relative to the current
---   window. For example,`style="BL"` will be shown in the bottom left corner.
--- - `scope="tabpage"`, `scope="editor"`, `scope="project"` will be shown relative to
---   the overall Neovim instance. For example,`style="BL"` will be shown in the
---   bottom left corner.
---
--- Identifiers of floating window and its buffer are stored as `floatwin_win_id`
--- and `floatwin_buf_id` in |MiniInput-state| <data> field.
--- Floating window is not focused and cursor position is not the same as caret
--- position.
---
---@param opts table|nil Options. Possible fields:
---   - <adjust_config> `(function)` - function to adjust default config. Will be
---     called with two arguments: current |MiniInput-state| and a window
---     config computed based on `opts.style` (always with `relative="editor"`
---     and `anchor="NW"`). Should return an adjusted window config.
---     Default: `function(state, config) return config end`.
---
---   - <style> `(string)` - a two character description of how window to be shown.
---     Default: `"BL"`.
---
---       First character describes vertical position:
---       - `"T"` - top window border will be at scope's reference top border.
---       - `"M"` - middle between top and bottom window borders will be at the
---         middle of scope's reference top and bottom borders.
---       - `"B"` - bottom window border will be at scope's reference bottom border.
---
---       Second character describes horizontal position:
---       - `"L"` - left window border will be at scope's reference left border.
---       - `"M"` - middle between left and right window borders will be at the
---         middle of scope's reference left and right borders.
---       - `"R"` - right window border will be at scope's reference right border.

--- Default key handler
---
--- Emulates most of |Command-line-mode| editing (|cmdline-editing|):
---
--- - Accept: <CR>. To insert literal newline, type `<C-j>`.
---
--- - Cancel: <Esc> or <C-c>.
---
--- - Move caret:
---     - <Left>, <Right> - one character to left / right.
---     - <M-h>, <M-l> - one character to left / right.
---     - <S-Left>, <S-Right> - one word to left / right.
---     - <C-b>, <C-e> (if no completion) - to start / end of input.
---     - <Home>, <End> - to start / end of input.
---
--- - Delete:
---     - <BS> / <C-h> - to caret's left. If `opts.autopair` is enabled, also delete
---       a character to caret's right if it formed a respected character pair.
---       See "Autopair".
---     - <Del> - at caret.
---     - <C-u> - from start to caret. As |c_CTRL-U|.
---     - <C-w> - contiguous keyword or non-keyword to caret's left. As |c_CTRL-W|.
---
--- - Insert at caret:
---     - <C-k> - digraph based on the next two pressed keys. As |c_CTRL-K|.
---     - <C-r> - content of a register. As |c_CTRL-R| including support for
---       special <C-a>, <C-f>, <C-l>, <C-w> keys for a register.
---     - <C-v>, <C-q> - next key literally. As |c_CTRL-V| and |i_CTRL-V_digit|
---       (all digits must be typed in full or stopped with <C-c>).
---
--- - Autopair (if `opts.autopair` is set) is similar to |mini.pairs|:
---     - Opening characters `(`, `[`, `{` always insert a `()`, `[]`, `{}` pair and places
---       caret inside of it.
---     - Closing characters `)`, `]`, `}` move caret to the right if there is the same
---       character to the right.
---     - Closeopen characters `'`, `"`, <`> perform "close" action if possible and
---       "open" action if not.
---     - In all cases press <C-v> before special character to insert it verbatim.
---
--- - Completion:
---     - <Tab>, <S-Tab> - start with `state.opts.completion` method if not active
---       and advance through active completion (i.e. replace currently displayed
---       at caret item with the next one).
---       Note: type `<C-v><Tab>` to insert literal `\t`.
---     - <C-n>, <C-p>, <Up>, <Down> - start with `"history"` method if not active
---       and advance through active completion.
---     - <C-e> - cancel and return to initial input and caret.
---     - <C-y> - accept current candidate. Note: it will also be accepted after
---       any key that doesn't advance completion.
---
--- - Miscellaneous:
---     - <C-o> - change scope of the input. Cycles through all available ones.
---     - <C-s> - change view style. Works only with |MiniInput.gen_view| view
---       handlers. Cycles through all available ones.
---     - <C-x> - toggle hide/unhide of the input.
---
--- - Special keys (combo, mouse, but not whitespace) not listed above - ignored.

--- Apply state's handler
---
--- Given `state`, apply its handler (from `state.opts.handlers`) and return the
--- modified state.
---
--- Notes:
--- - Nothing is done for highlight and complete handlers when input is hidden.
--- - Applying complete handler ensures that <complete> state field has <id> set
---   to 0 (as it assumes new completion) and <method> to the input argument
---   (empty string if there was no argument).
--- - Error during handler application is stored as <errmsg> field of output state
---   if there is an active input. It is propagated via |error()| otherwise.
--- - Handler output is validated to be a valid |MiniInput-state|. If not - return
---   input `state`. Note: it still could be changed if handler modified in place.
---
---@param state table A |MiniInput-state|.
---@param name string Valid handler name.
---@param arg any Extra handler argument: like `key` for key handler and `method`
---   for complete handler.
---
---@return table A |MiniInput-state| as a result of applied handler. If handler returned
---   nothing, the input `state` is returned (assumes it was modified in place).
